## Installation
### Pre-requisites
- GCC / G++ 12.2.0 (MinGW) - [Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-c-and-cpp-compiler-on-windows/)

- Compiling the program is done through `make`
- The following `make` commands are available (for windows only, sorry):
  * `all`: mapped to run
  * `build`: builds executable
  * `run`: runs executable (runs build if needed)
  * `clean`: deletes build directory and zip
  * `pack`: pack executable into a zip (runs build if needed)
  * `find`: list files which will be compiled
